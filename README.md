# Ember-Lunch-and-Learn

## ASH Documentation
This assumes you've gone through ASH's Ember setup documentation. If you have not or need this information, contact the Front End Team.

To get started, clone this repo locally and `ember init`. Each branch will take you through subsequent steps.

## Initial Setup (cloning this repo)
1. Make sure you have git setup on your computer
1. Create a folder on your local computer that will eventually hold this project (the rest of the steps should be done in the command line in that folder)
1. `git clone https://github.com/ASHdevelopment/Ember-Lunch-and-Learn.git`
1. `cd Ember-Lunch-and-Learn` to move into the folder that was downloaded
1. `ember init`. Do not overwrite any of the files when prompted.
1. If this is **NOT** your first time working in this project and you want to preserve the work you've already done, only select `Yes` to overwrite the following files: `app/index.html`, `test/index.html`, `config/environment.js`, `package.json`, `bower.json`, and `README.md`.
1. `ember s` will start the project locally in `http://localhost:4200`. Open [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to make sure it's working. 

## Shorthand
`ember g` = `ember generate`  
`ember s` = `ember serve`
